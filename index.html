								<h3>Nina (CEO and Founder)</h3>
								<br>
								<p>"Born and raised in the U.S. as a Chinese adoptee, I didn't start my language learning journey until the age of 14. I have won 2 prestigious scholarships funded by the U.S. Department of State, NSLIY and CLS. These gave me the opportunity to live with local host families and be immersed in Chinese language and culture. As one of the few adoptees who knew my birth family, I have found this language crucial for me to continue studying. I graduated from Wheaton College with a degree in international relations. I have always been very passionate about giving back to the Chinese adoptee community - I am working on founding a company funded scholarship for Chinese language and culture studies. I hope that one day I will be able to lead all of our adoptee students on a trip to China and act as a mentor. I want to proide an inclusive environment for younger Chinese adoptees and show them that Chinese language and culture is beautiful and help them reconnect with their roots. The unique part about this program is that it offers a free built in Chinese adoptee community. I really enjoy developing long term relationships with clients and seeing how their Mandarin skills increase."</p>
